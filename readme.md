End-to-end cloud data pipeline for processing and analyzing datasets from multiple movie streaming platforms using Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Power BI.

This project builds a cloud-based ETL pipeline that ingests, transforms, and visualizes data from various movie streaming platforms (e.g., Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu). Built using Azure services including Data Factory, Databricks, and Power BI, the pipeline enables centralized data analytics and reporting on movie metadata, ratings, release trends, and platform distribution.
